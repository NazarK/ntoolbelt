This is my experiment with building node modules.

This is a command line utility, which supposed to have shortcuts to usefull command line commands.

Currently only "nt pu" command available, which is shortcut for:
  git add .
  git commit -am "-"
  git push origin master

install with:
	npm install -g ntool

then command: "nt" will be available
